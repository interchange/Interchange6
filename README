NAME

    Interchange6 - Open Source Shop Machine

VERSION

    0.120

DESCRIPTION

    Interchange6, the Open Source Shop Machine, is the Modern Perl
    ecosystem for online business. It uses the DBIx::Class database schema
    Interchange6::Schema.

    This module provides the following APIs:

    Carts

      Interchange6::Cart

    Cart Products

      Interchange6::Cart::Product

    Cart Costs

      Interchange6::Cart::Cost

      Cart costs can be applied to both Carts and Cart Products and are
      integrated into each via the role Interchange6::Role::Costs.

    To build your own business website, please take a look at our Dancer
    plugin: Dancer::Plugin::Interchange6.

CART

    Interchange6 supports multiple carts, automatic collapsing of similar
    items and price caching.

CAVEATS

    Please anticipate API changes in this early state of development.
